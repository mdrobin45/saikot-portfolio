              I am currently working as a Lead Developer (Frontend) at
              <a href="https://www.skipperhospitality.com/"
                >Skipper Hospitality</a
              >. I am also a co-founder of
              <a href="https://reformedtech.org/">ReformedTech</a> and currently
              serve as the CTO of the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been dabbling on the web for more than a decade. JavaScript
              is the language of the web and my primary language of choice for
              programming. I also have experience in PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js,
              Typescript, Angular, MySQL, Laravel, Flutter, Swift, Django8,
              Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Tailwind and Java. My primary choice of
              frontend frameworks is React and Vue.js, although I have recently
              fallen in love with Svelte.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, my focus is on Frontend development, tooling, and developing
              tools to make the development experience smoother. I am a huge fan
              of the Jamstack architecture. Developing performant,
              user-friendly, and scaleable websites is a passion of mine. I also
              love to use WordPress and Shopify to build a quick website.
